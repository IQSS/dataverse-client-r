# CHANGES TO dvn 0.4 #

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES ##
* All functions that require an `objectid` argument (e.g., all functions to deposit and release a dataverse study) now accept an object of class "dvStudyAtom" (e.g., returned by `dvCreateStudy`) in addition to the previously supported objectid as character string. This should simply the process of creating, editing, and releasing studies. (#20)
* `dvExtractFileIds` now extracts non-data files from DDI-formatted metadata (#16) and exposes UNF signatures for data files (#15).
* `dvSearch` now supports searching in all metadata fields simultaneously by supplying a single character string, whereas a list containing a single, unnamed element is now treated as a valid query string (a change from how character strings were handled in versions < 0.3). See documentation.

## BUG FIXES ##
* SSL_VERIFYHOST was disabled in a previous release due to a certificate issue. It has now been reactivated. (h/t Hadley Wickham)
* Fixed a RCurl-related bug in `dvQuery` that prevented basic authentication for the Data Sharing API. `dvQuery` now uses username and password options, when specified, to authenticate requests.
* New versions of libcurl (>7.28) deprecate boolean values for options (e.g., SSL_VERIFYPEER and SSL_VERIFYHOST). `dvQuery` and `dvDepositQuery` were returning errors due to this and has been updated. Everything is backwards compatible to earlier versions of libcurl.


# CHANGES TO dvn 0.3 #

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES ##
* A `print` method has been added for `dvDownloadInfo` and the function additionally returns the raw value of the request. The return value of the function is otherwise unchanged.
* `dvSearch` now supports both boolean AND and boolean OR logic to combine multiple search terms. See documentation.
* `dvAddFile` no longer has a `filesize` argument (it being automatically calculated). The function now accepts filenames/paths (via `filename`) or dataframe names (via `dataframe`).
* Support for the Data Deposit API has been added in the form of a `dvDepositQuery` workhorse function and some wrappers that search a user's dataverse(s): `dvServiceDoc`, `dvUserStudies`, `dvStudyAtom`, and `dvStudyStatement`. Functions to create, release, and delete studies are also supported: `dvCreateStudy`, `dvReleaseStudy`, and `dvDeleteStudy`.
  * From v0.2.7, improved error handling provides more parsed XML/HTML error messages when `dvDepositQuery` fails (#11)
  * From v0.2.65, added S3 print methods for almost all of the Data Deposit functions.
  * From v0.2.6, the Study Atom is converted to a list in all relevant functions, making it easier to extract a study's `objectId`.
  * From v0.2.6, `dvUserStudies` and `dvStudyStatement` return a list of values (for use in subsequent functions), in addition to the raw XML.
  * From v0.2.6, `dvAddFile` accepts either a .zip or a vector of filenames, which are compressed together before adding.
  * From v0.2.4, dataverse username and password can be set globally with `options('dvn.user')` and `options('dvn.pwd')`.
  * From v0.2.35, `dvEditStudy` is also functional, along with both `dvAddFile` and `dvDeleteFile`.
* The default dataverse (Harvard IQSS Dataverse) is now specified as a global option, which can be user-redefined with `options('dvn')`.

## BUG FIXES ##
* Data Sharing API functions now attempt to fail gracefully when encountering unexpected API responses.
* Fixed a url space encoding bug in `dvSearch` that prevented the use of multiple search terms.
* Fixed a bug in `dvDownload` that failed to propagate the correct dataverse to `dvDownloadInfo` (h/t Egon Willighagen)

## DOCUMENTATION ##
* Documentation for `dvDownloadInfo` now provides more detail on its return value.
* Capitalization of 'objectId' has been standardized throughout the package and documentation updated accordingly.
* Package documenation now reports workflows for use of both the Data Sharing and Data Deposit APIs.


# CHANGES TO dvn 0.2 #

## BUG FIXES ##

* Removed SSL verification from `dvQuery` to prevent errors due to a new site certificate for DVN (released 2013-06-27). May be restored in a future version once RCurl stops producing an error.
