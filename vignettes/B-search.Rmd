Searching for data within Dataverse is quite easy using the `dataverse_search()` function. The simplest searches simply consist of a query string:


```r
library("dataverse")
Sys.setenv("DATAVERSE_SERVER" = "dataverse.harvard.edu")
dataverse_search("Gary King")[c("name")]
```

```

The results are paginated, so users can rely upon the `per_page` and `start` argument to requested subsequent pages of results. We'll start at 6 and to show that we retrieve the last five results from the previous query plus 15 more (due to `per_page = 20`):


```r
dataverse_search("Gary King", start = 6, per_page = 20)[c("name")]
```

More complicated searches can specify metadata fields like `title` and restrict results to a specific `type` of Dataverse object (a "dataverse", "dataset", or "file"):


```r
ei <- dataverse_search(author = "Gary King", title = "Ecological Inference", type = "dataset", per_page = 20)
```

```
## 20 of 867 results retrieved
```

```r
# fields returned
names(ei)
# names of datasets
ei$name
```

```

Once datasets and files are identified, it is easy to download and use them directly in R. See the ["Data Retrieval" vignette](C-retrieval.html) for details.
